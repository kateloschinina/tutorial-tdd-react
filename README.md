Getting more familiar with TDD with React
----

To understand better how to TDD with React I went through the following tutorials:
 - https://semaphoreci.com/community/tutorials/getting-started-with-tdd-in-react

 To run the result:
 ```
 $ git clone https://github.com/kateloschinina/tic-tac-toe-react.git
 $ npm install
 $ npm start
 ```
 To run tests:
 ```
 npm test
 ```

 Technologies Used:
 * React, Sinon docs, Enzyme docs, and Chai docs.
